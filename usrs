# Creating artists and music

## Genre and genre

- We should probably generate this at the same time, to imitate local scenes
- Each genre can have origin country, and a band from some country is more likely to pick the genre from this country.
- Countries with high number of artists are more likely to generate new artists?


# Creating new collections

- Each artist releases something based on:
    - random
    - some interval
    - artists's founded year
    - release history
    - *genre? country?

- More likely to release a single, then EP, then LP
    - perhaps different genres has different 
    - or some behaviours, like "3 singles 1 LP", etc.
        - each behaviour takes a certain amount of time with random and noise

So we activate an artist randomly, more likely the ones that recorded something recently, some old ones less likely.

# Creating new genres

- Randomly, very tiny chance when the artist is releasing something
- Most likely it's derived from something old
    - also maybe something new? just random?
